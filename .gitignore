# Ignoring files with full path.

# Ignoring directories
# Both the directory itself and its contents will be ignored.
vendor/

# Glob pattern can also be used here to ignore paths with certain characters.
# For example, [bB]uild/ rule will match both build/ and Build/

# Without the trailing slash, the rule will match a file and/or
# a directory, so the following would ignore both a file named `gen`
# and a directory named `gen`, as well as any contents of that directory

# Ignoring files by extension
# All files with these extensions will be ignored in
# this directory and all its sub-directories. *.apk *.class

# It's possible to combine both forms to ignore files with certain
# extensions in certain directories. The following rules would be
# redundant with generic rules defined above. java/*.apk gen/*.class

# To ignore files only at the top level directory, but not in its
# subdirectories, prefix the rule with a `/` /*.apk /*.class

# To ignore any directories named DirectoryA 
# in any depth use ** before DirectoryA
# Do not forget the last /, 
# Otherwise it will ignore all files named DirectoryA, rather than directories **/DirectoryA/
# This would ignore 
# DirectoryA/
# DirectoryB/DirectoryA/ 
# DirectoryC/DirectoryB/DirectoryA/
# It would not ignore a file named DirectoryA, at any level

# To ignore any directory named DirectoryB within a 
# directory named DirectoryA with any number of 
# directories in between, use ** between the directories DirectoryA/**/DirectoryB/
# This would ignore 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryB/ 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryQ/DirectoryB/ 
# DirectoryA/DirectoryQ/DirectoryW/DirectoryB/

# To ignore a set of files, wildcards can be used, as can be seen above.
# A sole '*' will ignore everything in your folder, including your .gitignore file.
# To exclude specific files when using wildcards, negate them.
# So they are excluded from the ignore list: !.gitignore 

# Use the backslash as escape character to ignore files with a hash (#)
# (supported since 1.6.2.1) \#*#
